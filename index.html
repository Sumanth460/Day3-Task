    <span class="s1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a></span> (14 March 1879 18 April 1955) was a German-born<span class="s2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics"> theoretical physicist</a></span> who is best known for developing the <span class="s3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">theory of relativity.</a></span> 
    Einstein also made important contributions to <span class="s4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics.</a></span>
    His <span class="s5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence">mass energy equivalence</a></span> formula <span class="s6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence#Mass%E2%80%93velocity_relationship">E = mc2</a></span>, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation".
    He received the 1921 <mark class="s7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a></mark> for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the <span clas="s8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">photoelectric effect.</a></span>
    Born in the <span class="s11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire">German Empire</a></span>, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg)[note 1] the following year.
    In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss <span class="s9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich">federal polytechnic school</a></span> in <span class="s10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a></span>, graduating in 1900. 
    He acquired <span class="s12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_nationality_law">Swiss citizenship</a></span> a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.
    In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. 
    In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.
    [note 1] In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.
    Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews,[8] he decided to remain in the US, and was granted <span class="s13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States">American citizenship</a></span> in 1940.
    On the eve of <span class="s14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a></span>, he endorsed<span class="s15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard_letter"> a letter</a></span> to <span class="s16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt">President Franklin D.
    Roosevelt</a></span> alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research.
